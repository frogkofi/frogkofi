hii, I'm Kofi, welcome to my README as you can see i like frog🐸. 
But wait! that's not all, i like playing funky jazz on piano, baking sweets🥐 (mostly the easy ones ;;) and learning new things.
I mostly work with python, golang and C++ but i love trying new languages so i don't really have my absolutely favorite one yet.
